Notes:

The idea is to create a system of interacting objects

The data in each object can have a different state from other instances of the same class

Each object can react to method calls differently because of the differences in state

OO design is all about figuring out what the objects are and how they interact

Aggregation is also exactly like composition except aggregate objects can exist independently
