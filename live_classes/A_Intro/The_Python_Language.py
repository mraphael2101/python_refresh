Python Characteristics:

Python is a general-purpose open source computer programming language, optimized for quality,
productivity, portability, and integration. It is used by hundreds of thousands of developers around the world,
in areas such as Internet scripting, systems programming, user interfaces, product customization, and more.
Among other things, Python sports object-oriented programming; a remarkably simple, readable, and maintainable syntax;
integration with C components; and a vast collection of preceded interfaces and utilities. Although general-purpose,
Python is often called a scripting language because it makes it easy to utilize and direct other software components.
Perhaps Python's best asset is simply that it makes software development more rapid and enjoyable.

  -> Easy to Code
  -> Easy to Read (has an elegant syntax)
  -> Is opensource and completely free to use for commercial purposes
  -> Has an extensive Standard Library which includes image manipulation, databases and unit-testing,
     among other functionalities. In addition, there are thousands of components readily available
     from the Python Package Index https://pypi.org
  -> Is Interpreted as it executes the code line by line and not all at once (there is no compilation)
  -> Is portable and runs on most platforms including Windows and Linux
  -> Python supports both Object-oriented and Procedural programming paradigms
     (data and objects vs functions & logic)
  -> Python code is extensible and can be integrated with other languages like C++, Java and Go
  -> Is Expressive in the sense that only a few lines of code perform complex tasks
  -> Supports various toolkits for GUI based development
  -> Is a Dynamically typed language that determines the variable type at runtime rather than before
  -> Is a high-level programming language that is programmer friendly
  -> Simplifies Complex Software Development
