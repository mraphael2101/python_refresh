"""
In Python, there is a subtle difference between an error and an exception

Errors cannot be handled, while Python exceptions can be handled at runtime


An Error might indicate critical problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch,
while an Exception might indicate conditions that an application should try to catch.

Errors are a form of an unchecked exception and are irrecoverable like an OutOfMemoryError ,
which a programmer should not try to handle

Performing the above increases the robustness of your code
